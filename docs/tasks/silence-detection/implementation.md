# Silence Detection Implementation - Progress Report

## Date: 2025-06-27

## Summary
Successfully implemented WebRTC VAD-based silence detection for voice_mode. The feature automatically stops recording when users stop speaking, eliminating the need to wait for full duration timeout.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Implementation
- Added `record_audio_with_silence_detection()` function in `voice_mode/tools/conversation.py`
- Integrated WebRTC VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to monitor speech in real-time
- Processes audio in 30ms chunks for low-latency detection
- Stops recording after configurable silence threshold (default: 800ms)

### 2. Key Issues Resolved

#### Sample Rate Compatibility (FIXED)
- **Problem**: WebRTC VAD only supports 8kHz, 16kHz, or 32kHz, but voice_mode uses 24kHz
- **Solution**: Extract appropriate number of samples for VAD processing at 16kHz
- **Code**: Lines 739-743, 779-780 in conversation.py

#### Import Error in MCP Environment (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `ImportError: No module named 'pkg_resources'` when importing webrtcvad
- **Solution**: Added `setuptools` to dependencies in pyproject.toml
- **Debug**: Added import debugging that writes to `/tmp/voicemode_vad_import.txt`

#### Default Configuration (FIXED)
- **Changed**: Default from `false` to `true` for `VOICEMODE_ENABLE_SILENCE_DETECTION`
- **Files**: Updated config.py, docs/silence-detection.md, CHANGELOG.md

### 3. Testing Results

#### Standalone Python Test (WORKING)
```bash
python /tmp/test_silence.py
# Result: Successfully detected silence after 3.6s, stopped recording
# Total duration: 14.4s (including startup time)
```

#### MCP Integration (PARTIALLY WORKING)
- Silence detection function is being called
- VAD is properly initialized
- However, recording durations through MCP are longer than expected:
  - Expected: ~2-5s for short responses
  - Actual: 11-36s (variable)

### 4. Configuration
```bash
# Environment variables (all have sensible defaults)
VOICEMODE_ENABLE_SILENCE_DETECTION=true  # Enable/disable (default: true)
VOICEMODE_VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS=2          # 0-3, higher = more aggressive
VOICEMODE_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS=800      # Stop after 800ms silence
VOICEMODE_MIN_RECORDING_DURATION=0.5    # Minimum recording time
```

### 5. Debug Information

#### Debug Files Created
- `/tmp/voicemode_silence_debug.txt` - Tracks when function is called
- `/tmp/voicemode_vad_import.txt` - Shows VAD import success/failure

#### Key Debug Points
- Module load: Prints `MODULE LOAD: ENABLE_SILENCE_DETECTION=True/False`
- Function entry: Logs VAD availability and config status
- Silence detection: Prints "BREAKING: Silence detected after X.Xs"

### 6. Remaining Issues

#### MCP Timing Discrepancy
The silence detection works perfectly in standalone tests but has timing issues when called through MCP:
- Possible causes:
  - Audio buffering in MCP transport layer
  - Different async/thread handling
  - Event loop differences
  - Audio chunks being processed differently

#### Next Steps for Investigation
1. Add more detailed timing logs in the recording loop
2. Check if MCP is adding additional buffering
3. Investigate if asyncio executor is affecting chunk timing
4. Compare chunk processing timing between standalone and MCP contexts

### 7. Files Modified
- `voice_mode/tools/conversation.py` - Main implementation
- `voice_mode/config.py` - Added silence detection config variables
- `pyproject.toml` - Added webrtcvad and setuptools dependencies
- `docs/silence-detection.md` - User documentation
- `docs/tasks/silence-detection-design.md` - Design document
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with new feature
- `README.md` - Added silence detection to features list
- `docs/tasks/implementation-notes.md` - Added to completed features
- `docs/tasks/key-insights.md` - Added technical insights

### 8. Code Snippets for Reference

#### Working Silence Detection Loop (conversation.py:762-811)
```python
while recording_duration < max_duration:
    # Record chunk
    chunk = sd.rec(chunk_samples, samplerate=SAMPLE_RATE, channels=CHANNELS, dtype=np.int16)
    sd.wait()
    
    # Process for VAD (handles sample rate mismatch)
    vad_chunk = chunk_flat[:vad_chunk_samples]
    is_speech = vad.is_speech(vad_chunk.tobytes(), vad_sample_rate)
    
    # Track silence
    if is_speech:
        speech_detected = True
        silence_duration_ms = 0
    else:
        silence_duration_ms += VAD_CHUNK_DURATION_MS
    
    # Stop if silence threshold reached
    if speech_detected and recording_duration >= MIN_RECORDING_DURATION:
        if silence_duration_ms >= SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MS:
            logger.info(f"âœ“ Silence detected after {recording_duration:.1f}s")
            break
```

### 9. Conclusion
The silence detection feature is functionally complete and working correctly in isolation. The remaining issue is specific to MCP integration timing, which may require deeper investigation into how MCP handles audio streams and async execution.
